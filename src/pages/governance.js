					<h2 className="gov-subheading">community treasury</h2>
					<p>
						The unofficial mfers community treasury is a Gnosis-safe multi-sig
						secured by the following signers:
					</p>

					<ul>
						{TREASURY_SIGNERS.map(signer => (
							<li key={`signer-${signer.name}`}>
								<ExtLink href={signer.twitter}>{signer.name}</ExtLink>
							</li>

					</ul>
					<br />

					<p>
						<strong>

					<p>
						Three use-specific subdomains exist under unofficialmfers.eth. Each
						sub-domain is also connected to a Gnosis safe multi-sig with three
						signers each.

					<h2 className="gov-subheading">proposal process</h2>
					<p>
						When taking actions such as transacting with the community multi-sig
						or altering core governance processes, a proposal is required to
						outline the action to take and the plan on how to execute it.
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>
							Here are the <em>current formal steps</em> of the unofficial mfers
							proposal pipeline:
						</strong>
					</p>

					<ol className="prop-process-list">
						<li>
							<p>
								An initiative is surfaced and discussed within the mfers
								community across social platforms.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								A proposal is drafted by the initiative organizers with details
								about their plan of execution and requirements they need. This
								proposal is submitted to the signers via the intake form{' '}
								<ExtLink href={PROP_SUBMISSION_LINK}>here</ExtLink> and
								considered on a basis it is not damaging and the action makes
								sense for the unofficial mfers to take at the time.
							</p>
							<p>
								This selection process is a current veto power held by the
								signers, as the signers select which proposals move forward in
								the pipeline.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								If selected, the proposal will be presented to the community in
								the{' '}
								<ExtLink href={DISCORD_LINK}>unofficial mfers Discord</ExtLink>{' '}
								for a "soft pass" with a minimum voting time of 48 hours and a
								majority vote amongst mfer holders.
							</p>
							<p>
								This "soft pass" notifies the community of a potential upcoming
								governance action and allows for feedback. The "soft pass"
								proposal may be amended and re-submitted if it does not pass in
								the vote or if mfers would like amendments.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Should the soft pass reach majority vote upon completion of the
								voting timeframe, the proposal (in its soft-passed form) can
								then be posted to SnapShot for a token-weighted vote (1 mfer = 1
								vote) for a voting period open for a minimum of 72 hours.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								If the <ExtLink href={SNAPSHOT_LINK}>SnapShot vote</ExtLink>{' '}
								reaches a majority vote within the voting timeframe, the action
								outlined in the proposal is executed.
							</p>
							<p>
								If the action involves any transactions using the community
								treasury, or its sub-treasuries, the signers securing those
								multi-sigs shall execute those transactions.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>

					<h2 className="gov-subheading">snapshot</h2>
